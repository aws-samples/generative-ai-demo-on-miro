### Architecture overview

- **Miro application** is running on the board. Loaded from S3 bucket, accessed via CloudFront distribution. Written on TypeScript.
- **Authorization and AIML proxy lambdas.** Accessed via APIGateway deployed behind CloudFront. Written on Python.
   - ***Authorization function `authorize`*** provide access to backend functions only for authorized Miro application. It's used to protect organization data and generated content in AWS account.
   - ***AIML proxy function `mlInference`*** is required to handle API call from application and redirect it to Amazon Bedrock model.

## To begin setup Generative AI demo in your AWS account, follow these steps:

### Start with creating Miro application

#### 1. Familiarize yourself with Miro's Developer Platform:
   Visit the Miro Developer Platform documentation (**[https://developers.miro.com/docs](https://developers.miro.com/docs)**) to learn about the available APIs, SDKs, and other resources that can help you build your app.
#### 2. Create [Miro Developer Team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team)
ðŸ’¡ If you already have ***Miro Developer Team*** in you account, skip this step.

![Build App](./media/build-app-button.png)


#### 3. Go to the Miro App management Dashboard (**[https://miro.com/app/settings/user-profile/apps/](https://miro.com/app/settings/user-profile/apps/)**) 
and click "**Create new app**". 

![Create New App Button](./media/create-new-app.png)
Fill in the necessary information about your app, such as its name, select Developer team. Note: you don't need to check the "Expire user authorization token" checkbox. Click "**Create app**" to create your app.

#### 4. Copy client secret on app creation page

<img src="./media/create-new-app-client-secret.png" alt="secret" width="500"/>

### Now everything ready to set up backend
#### 5. Configure CLI access to AWS account via [profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html) or [environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)
   
   <details>
   <summary>ðŸ‘‡ Demo operator user/role policies </summary>
   (steps below developed and tested in Cloud9 and Sagemaker, role with following policies)

   ```
   IAMFullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess, AmazonSSMFullAccess, CloudWatchLogsFullAccess,
   CloudFrontFullAccess, AmazonAPIGatewayAdministrator, AWSCloudFormationFullAccess, 
   AWSLambda_FullAccess, AmazonBedrockFullAccess, AmazonSageMakerFullAccess
   ```

   </details>


#### 6. Bootstrap CDK stack in the target account: 
`cdk bootstrap aws://<account_id>/<region>`

#### 7. Docker buildx is required to build Graviton2 Lambda images on x86 platform. 
It could be either used from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) package - no need in steps 7.1 and 7.2 in this case; or installed separately (steps below developed and tested on [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)):
   1. [Binary installation manual](https://docs.docker.com/build/install-buildx/)
   2. On x86 platform to enable multiarch building capability launch
   
      `docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes`

#### 8. Configure Miro application client secret 
Edit `deployment-config.json` to authorize Miro application to access backend. Find the following parameter and put as value secret string you received in [step 4](#4-copy-client-secret-on-app-creation-page).
```
"clientAppSecret": "ADD_MIRO_APP_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE",
```

#### 9. Deploy backend
Run `npm run deploy` from the project root folder. You will be requested to provide ``application client secret`` to continue installation. When installation is completed, all the necessary resources are deployed as **CloudFormation** `DeployStack` in the target account. Write down CloudFront HTTPS distrubution address:
```
    DeployStack.DistributionOutput = xyz123456.cloudfront.net
```


#### 10. Return to Miro application creation dialog to complete app configuration
Please enter the CloudFront URL that you obtained on the previous step.

<img src="./media/app-url.png" alt="App Url" width="500"/>

#### 11. Add necessary permission.

<img src="./media/permissions.png" alt="Permissions" width="500"/>

#### 12. Install the app to the team.

<img src="./media/install-app.png" alt="Install App" width="500"/>

#### Back to the Miro Developer Dashboard, click "More apps" icon on application bar, find your just installed app in the list and start working.

### Bedrock models

**You need to request access to the Bedrock models you are planning to use in sufficient regions.**

Please follow [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to request access.
Models used in this sample defined in **`./frontend/src/data/scenarios.json`** file, available regions and resolutions per model defined in **`./frontend/src/data/regions.json`** and **`./frontend/src/data/resolutions.json`**.
Based on your selection of models and regions you can update this files to keep frontend options consistent.



### Sagemaker endpoints (optional)

Previous version of the sample (basic frontend and Sagemaker enpoints only support) could be found in the dedicated [repo branch](https://github.com/aws-samples/generative-ai-demo-on-miro/tree/sagemaker-endpoints-only)

**You may run dedicated Sagemaker endpoints if you'd like to run your own use-cases.**
Each of sample use-cases is supported by a separate Jupyter notebook in **`./ml_services/<use_case>`** subdirectory:
- `1-create_image` image generation (Stable diffusion 2.1), based on [this example](https://github.com/aws/studio-lab-examples/blob/main/generative-deep-learning/stable-diffusion-finetune/JumpStart_Stable_Diffusion_Inference_Only.ipynb)
- `2-inpaint_image` image inpainting (Stable diffusion 2 Inpainting fp16), based on [this example](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/jumpstart_inpainting/Amazon_JumpStart_Inpainting.ipynb)
- `3-modify_image` image pix2pix modification (Huggingface instruct pix2pix), based on [this example](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/main/advanced_functionality/huggingface_deploy_instructpix2pix)

 ðŸ’¡ ***These steps developed and tested in Sagemaker notebook. For cases 1 and 2 you also can use any other ways to run Jumpstart referenced models, i.e. Sagemaker Studio***


#### Starting Sagemaker endpoints

- Go to **./ml_services/<use_case>** directory and run one-by-one all three Sagemaker notebooks.
- After endpoint started and successfully tested in notebook, go to **Miro board**, select required items and run use-case.


### Demo extension with additional use-cases

The demo could be extended in various ways, e.g. by adding new use-cases, changing interface or improving existing functionality.
Existing environment can be used as boilerplate.
